Epanox:	Welcome to egypt traveller...it seems like you've travelled through time.
Nemo: 	Uhhmm what the hell happened to me?
Epanox:	It seems like you've travelled through time, well anyways now that your here, would you like to help me? 
	  	If you do, I might now of a way to send you back into your time.
Nemo: 	Yes please...
Epanox:	You need to go inside the Pyramide, there you will find treasures that you can take with you.
		What I ask of you, is that you kill all the monsters that have infested this dungeon.
		At the end of the dungeon you will find a boss monster which you need to defeeat in order to obtain an time crystal...
Nemo: 	A time crystal? Is that what I need to travel back?
Epanox:	Yes and no, the time crystal opens a portal which allowes one to travell into the future, but only a few hundred years at a time...
Nemo:		Alright I get the gist of it, I shall go then, thanks for the tips...
